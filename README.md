## Horiseon Refactoring Challenge

## Description
This project showcases an example of refactored HTML and CSS coding from an pre-existing coded source. The "client's" goal of this refactoring allows for accesibility standards so that the site is optimied for search engines. Optimization for this code source included implemnting Semantic HTML elements as well as class and ID tags in place if or along with non-semantic tags to increase the understandability of the code lines and how they would be displayed on the webpage. The CSS code was approariately edited as well to match their corresponding elements from the HTML document it was link to. The original code source that this refactoring project was based on the HTML and CSS code from this source: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram | Repository: urban-octo-telegram
